Caveats:
"1. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Unreliable."
"2. About sub-national population figures for regions, divisions, states and counties: population figures for 1999 are from the"
"1990-1999 series of bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population; population figures for 2000 and 2010"
"are bridged-race April 1 census counts; population figures for 2001-2009 are from the revised 2000-2009 series of bridged-race"
"intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population; and population figures for 2011-2015 are bridged-race postcensal"
"estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2015 series released by NCHS on June 28, 2016."
"3. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Not Stated."
"4. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Racial Differences."
"5. As of April 3, 2017, the underlying cause of death has been revised for 125 deaths in 2014. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#2014-Revision."
